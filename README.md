This is a simple project intended to demonstrate some React practices, together with ES6 and JSX.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Check the [demo](https://ns-gwroassptn.now.sh/) first.

Now read the source as a blog post.
Get started by visiting the `index.html`.

_Note_: For the sake of simplicity I've intentionally removed testing from the project even though CRApp creates the required configuration for it.
The idea of this demo is to introduce the programming patterns and React principles, not the full-blown production-ready workflow.
